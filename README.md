## Project Overview
TrackHeat is a web-based application designed to visualize your GPX track data as a heatmap. This tool allows users to upload their GPX files, which contain GPS tracking information, and then generates an interactive heatmap highlighting the most frequently visited paths. Ideal for athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban planners, TrackHeat provides insights into movement patterns, popular routes, and areas of high activity.

## Key Features

1. **GPX File Upload:** Easy and intuitive interface for uploading multiple GPX files.
2. **Interactive Heatmap:** Dynamic heatmap generation to visually represent track density and frequency.
3. **Data Integration:** Supports merging data from various GPX files to create comprehensive heatmaps.
4. **Customization Options:** Users can adjust heatmap intensity, color schemes, and map styles to suit their preferences.
5. **Statistics and Insights:** Offers basic analytics such as total distance, elevation gain, and time spent on different routes.
6. **Map Overlays:** Integration with popular map services (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) for detailed geographic context.
7. **Sharing and Exporting:** Options to share heatmaps on social media or export them as images/PDFs for offline use.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the web pages and ensuring a semantic layout.
- **CSS:** For styling the application, making it visually appealing and responsive across devices.
- **JavaScript:** For interactive functionality, including file uploads, data processing, and dynamic heatmap rendering.
  - **Leaflet.js:** For map rendering and overlays.
  - **Leaflet.heat:** For creating the heatmap visualizations.

## Target Audience

- **Athletes and Runners:** Track performance and discover popular running routes.
- **Cyclists:** Analyze frequent biking paths and plan new routes.
- **Hikers and Outdoor Enthusiasts:** Visualize hiking trails and explore new areas.
- **Urban Planners:** Understand public movement patterns for infrastructure development.

TrackHeat combines the power of geospatial data with intuitive visualization, making it easier than ever to analyze and share your outdoor adventures and activities.
